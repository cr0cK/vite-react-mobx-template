# Components Directory

This directory organizes React components into a structured, scalable, and maintainable hierarchy. Each folder serves a specific purpose, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation as the application grows.

## Folder Breakdown and Rationale

### **1. `layout/`**
   - Contains components that define the overall layout of the application.
   - Includes **Header**, **Footer**, and **Sidebar** components, which are foundational for page structure.
   - **Why?**
     - Separating layout-related components simplifies reusability and ensures layout consistency across pages.
   - Example Components:
     - `Header.tsx`: Main header of the application.
     - `Footer.tsx`: Footer appearing on all pages.
     - `PageLayout.tsx`: Wrapper for layout-specific logic (e.g., theme handling).

---

### **2. `navigation/`**
   - Focuses on components related to user navigation within the app.
   - Includes elements like **Breadcrumbs**, **Navbar**, and **TabNavigator**.
   - **Why?**
     - Navigation components are frequently reused and may involve complex logic, so grouping them makes maintenance easier.
   - Example Components:
     - `Navbar.tsx`: Main navigation bar.
     - `Breadcrumb.tsx`: Breadcrumb trail for hierarchical navigation.
     - `routes.ts`: Centralized routing configuration.

---

### **3. `menus/`**
   - Houses components for menu-related functionality, such as dropdowns, context menus, and side menus.
   - **Why?**
     - Menus often share similar functionality and design patterns, so centralizing them avoids redundancy.
   - Example Components:
     - `DropdownMenu.tsx`: Generic dropdown menu.
     - `SidebarMenu.tsx`: Menu for side navigation.
     - `MenuItem.tsx`: Reusable item component for menus.

---

### **4. `modals/`**
   - Groups reusable modal components and their supporting logic.
   - Includes a `useModal` hook to handle open/close state and logic for modals.
   - **Why?**
     - Modals are common UI elements with shared functionality; grouping them avoids duplication and improves consistency.
   - Example Components:
     - `ConfirmationModal.tsx`: Modal for confirming actions.
     - `FormModal.tsx`: Modal that contains a form.
     - `ModalWrapper.tsx`: Wrapper for modal styling and functionality.

---

### **5. `generic/`**
   - Contains reusable components that are not tied to any specific feature.
   - Includes components like **Button**, **Forms**, **Icons**, and **Tooltips**.
   - **Why?**
     - General-purpose components are used across the app, so grouping them avoids duplication and improves reusability.
   - Example Components:
     - `Button.tsx`: A configurable button component.
     - `Icon.tsx`: A generic icon component.
     - `Form/`: A folder containing input fields, checkboxes, and other form-related components.

---

### **6. `specific/`**
   - Contains components specific to individual pages or features.
   - Subfolders are created for each page or feature, such as **HomePage** or **LoginPage**.
   - **Why?**
     - Organizing page-specific components into subfolders improves modularity and maintainability.
   - Example Subfolders:
     - `HomePage/`: Contains components unique to the home page.
     - `LoginPage/`: Components for the login page, such as `LoginForm.tsx`.
     - `DashboardPage/`: Components for the dashboard, such as `DashboardStats.tsx`.

---

### **7. `index.ts`**
   - Serves as a central export point for all components in the directory.
   - **Why?**
     - Simplifies imports by allowing you to import components from a single file.
   - Example Usage:
     ```typescript
     export * from './layout';
     export * from './navigation';
     export * from './menus';
     export * from './modals';
     export * from './generic';
     export * from './specific';
     ```

---

## Why This Structure?

1. **Scalability**:
   - As the application grows, new components can be easily added to the appropriate folder without disrupting the structure.

2. **Maintainability**:
   - Grouping components by functionality (layout, navigation, modals, etc.) makes it easier for developers to find and update them.

3. **Reusability**:
   - Reusable components like `Button`, `Form`, or `ModalWrapper` are centralized to avoid redundancy.

4. **Modularity**:
   - Page-specific components are isolated in the `specific/` folder, keeping the rest of the codebase clean and focused.

---

## Adding New Components

When adding a new component:
1. **Determine its purpose**:
   - If it’s reusable, place it in `generic/`.
   - If it’s page-specific, place it in `specific/` under the appropriate page folder.
   - If it relates to navigation, menus, or modals, place it in the corresponding folder.

2. **Export the Component**:
   - Add the component to `index.ts` for centralized imports.
